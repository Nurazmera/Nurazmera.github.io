<h2> Support The Global Coral Reef Alliance </h2>
    <p> 
      The Global Coral Reef Alliance (GCRA) is a non-profit organization dedicated to saving coral reefs and raising awareness to coral reef bleaching.  
The GCRA understands that learning about the importance of coral reefs and ways to help can inspire people to do their part. The GCRA travels all over the world to educate people on coral reefs. .According to the GCRA education and active participation are the only ways we will be able to save coral reefs as a society. The GCRA places top priority on working with indigenous cultures, specifically sea peoples to work with them in restoring their sacred ecosystem. The GCRA works with all types of communities. An example being the Pemutaeran community in Bali. This community suffered a lot because of the huge amounts of coral loss in their reefs. With the aid of the GCRA this community started a foundation overseeing the implementation of over 70 Biorock coral reefs restoring fish stocks which has helped feed their community. And so, with the hardwork and of the GCRA we can have hope of future generations having coral reefs.
