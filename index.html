       Yes, Coral Reefs! These hidden gems in the sea are a lot more important then people realize and are in even more danger. This is because of a problem known as Coral Reef Bleaching

    <p class="bleaching">
      The Ocean takes the majority of the hit for global warming. (LuAnn Dahlman and Rebecca Lindsey,2020) 

We don't feel the effects of global warming on earth as much as we would if the ocean was not there.
The Ocean takes over 90% of the warming caused by human activities.  With the oceans rising rapidly, coral reefs and not reacting well. Coral reefs go through something called, “bleaching”
According to an article written by Kirsten Guileanu in 2017, “The hot water stresses corals, forcing them to expel the colorful algae living inside them”. Without the alege, miles and miles of vibrant coral reefs are turning into white barren graveyards. This is because algae plays an important role in corals. Algae protects coral from being vulnerable to disease and death. Algae also produces oxygen to remove waste from the coral as well as produces glucose which is used as food. Coral reefs have tried to adapt to the fast water rising rates.
